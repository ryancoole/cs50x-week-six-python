# CS50x - Week 6: Python

This repo contains my solutions for **Week 6** of Harvard's [CS50x](https://pll.harvard.edu/course/cs50-introduction-computer-science) course. The focus this week was on learning the basics of **python**.

---

## ✅ Projects

### `hello`
A simple program that prompts the user for their name and prints a personalized greeting. A direct rewrite of the `Hello` problem from Week 1, now implemented in Python.

### `mario`
Recreates the classic half-pyramid pattern from Super Mario Bros using hashes (#). The user specifies the height, and the program prints a right-aligned pyramid. Demonstrates input validation, loops, and formatted output in Python.

### `credit`
Implements a credit card validator that identifies whether a given number is Visa, MasterCard, or American Express using the Luhn algorithm. A faithful Python version of the earlier C problem, focusing on arithmetic logic and condition handling.

### `readability`
Calculates the readability grade of a text using the Coleman–Liau index. Prompts for user input and outputs the USA grade level needed to comprehend the text. Highlights text parsing, counting letters, words, and sentences, and performing precise floating-point calculations.

### `dna`
A program that identifies a person based on their DNA sequence. Given a CSV file of individuals’ Short Tandem Repeat counts and a DNA sequence, it determines whose DNA matches the sequence. Demonstrates file reading, string processing, and nested data structure handling in Python.
